I created a website for the construction company "Construct," which is one of the newly developing campaigns and has its headquarters in Andijan, 
using the new design and Html, CSS, and JavaScript languages. The purpose of the website is to communicate more easily with the target customers 
and provide information about its products and the opinions of its customers.  Let me introduce the function of this website, this website consists 
of 6 pages and helps to share information about each of their campaigns. The <a> tag is connected by href to connect each page, and there is one CSS
page for each page, which will exhibit the website in a better design. Mainly extracted from the media query and display grid properties to display the 
website in mobile and other versions. Basic JavaScript was used for website animation changes. using this language, I used the animation from the bottom 
to the top when the website is scrolled, the changes in the responsive state of the navbar, and the creation of animations in the questions section.  
During the creation of this, I had trouble adapting the CSS to the mobile version and the tablet version. Also, I had trouble with JavaScript animations in 
buttons parts, and I found a solution for them by searching through google. I also used Font Awesome, a website that shares icons for social media, navbar bars, 
and other elements to create this website.
